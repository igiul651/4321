                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>We believe that yummy sweets should be enjoyed by everyone, so we've created our
				own Vegan candy source of deliciousness.Vegan candy contains no ingredients derived
				from animals—no dairy, no gelatine, no honey, and no bone-char refined sugar(and we
				think that's pretty sweet). We are determined to bring you old classics and new tastes
				from around the world! With just the two of us here we are working on building our business
				in order to give back to animal rescue charities and to make plant-based confectionery the norm.
				We donate 5% of our profits to Brook Farm Animal Sanctuary. Brook FarmAnimal Sanctuary mainly rescues
				farmed animals, though it takes in any animal of any species in need of help.You can find
				more information about this amazing sanctuary by clicking here.We also believe that sustainability is
				important. We love
				our planet and all the creatures on it. And that’s why we’re working hard behind the scenes to use as
				much eco-friendly
				packaging as possible.</p>
